## Use Case:

**__ Configuring Camunda History with generic properties __**

###  There are a few options for configuring History Cleanup. All the options rely on the process engine configuration of some sort.

IMPORTANT: See *_Option 3_* to use generic-properties which is what I think will work for your case. Included the other options just in case.

####    1. You can utilize process.xml or camunda.cfg.xml as described here.
https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-bootstrapping/#configure-process-engine-using-camunda-cfg-xml

####    See the following for the config properties that can be set for history cleanup and other engine configuration properties.
https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine/#history-cleanup-configuration-parameters

####    2. or you can use code config as described here
https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration/#adding-additional-configurations

TIP: In the case of spring-boot you can utilize Component Scanning and @Value annotations to quickly create your own properties and hook this into a yaml config via a process-engine-plugin.

####    3. use generic-properties
See https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration/#generic-properties

####  Here are the available configs for the process-engine-configuration
https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine/#configuration-properties

####    To use generic-properties just find the property in the configuration-properties doc above than add a hyphen "-" between words and remove camel case like ```historyCleanupStrategy``` becomes ```history-cleanup-strategy```.

####    Also here are the additional spring-boot properties that you can use in YAML.
