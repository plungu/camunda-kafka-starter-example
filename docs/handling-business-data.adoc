## Handling Business Data and UI Integration
TIP: See the pattern described in the Camunda Best Practices https://camunda.com/best-practices/handling-data-in-processes/[Handling Data In Processes] and https://camunda.com/best-practices/enhancing-tasklists-with-business-data/[Enhancing Tasklist with Business Data]

====
Often and for numerous reasons we need to consolidate data from different sources. In this app I use JPA and Spring REST with some of springs features to build a custom API. Primarily for making integration with the UI easier. Here are few reasons why I take this approach.

- Reduce queries the UI does to the backend
- Make it easier to build UI components
- Create abstraction layer that can be used to integrate other technical and business requirements like reporting and security.
- Have a source of truth for process meta-data

NOTE: Also keep in mind I want to keep every-thing self contained for PoC purposes. Think in logical terms and that these components could be another technology or several other technologies depending on the specific needs.

#### Camunda REST API
====
Camunda has a powerful rest API. This code repository has many examples of interacting with the CAMUNDA REST API from the custom UI and using postman. See the `postman` folder in the project home.

Import the postman collection and take a look at the queries to start the workflow and correlate messages.

see more https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/[CAMUNDA REST API]

#### JPA Spring Data Repositories
====
A separate API and logically separate data-store is used to query order data.

We can guarantee the data is updated in the data store with the workflow. See the section above on the JavaDelegates that implement the publishing functionality.

https://spring.io/blog/2011/02/10/getting-started-with-spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] is the technology used for business data. Spring Data allows for an easy way to create API's that are easy for a UI to query. Also an easy way to combine data into a useful form for the UI to consume.
